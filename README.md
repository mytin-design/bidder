This is a studybay bot - playwright. 
Starts well - stores sessions, logins well and redirects to assignments page really well
main issue is bidding strategy

Confirmed Bidding Process & Selectors:
âœ… Bidding Location: Individual order pages (e.g., /order/getoneorder/3842025)

âœ… Updated Selectors:

Order Link: .orderA-converted__name âœ“ (confirmed from your HTML)
Bid Button: button.styled__MakeBidButton-sc-18augvm-9 âœ“ (matches your "Place a Bid" button)
Container: div.orderA-converted__contentWrapper âœ“ (confirmed from your HTML)
ðŸ”„ Process Flow:

/search page: AJAX filter apply button â†’ DOM updates with new orders
Extract URLs: From .orderA-converted__name href attributes
Open individual order pages: Navigate to each order URL
Place bids: Click "Place a Bid" button on each order page
The bot correctly operates on individual order pages for bidding, while using the /search page purely for AJAX-based order discovery without page reloads.




Intelligent Bot Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Order Intelligence & Filtering
Priority: HIGH - Prevents wasted bids on unsuitable orders

Step 1.1: Order Data Extraction

Extract order details: budget, deadline, bid count, subject, customer status
Parse order descriptions for keywords and requirements
Identify order complexity (word count, file attachments)
Step 1.2: Smart Order Filtering

Competition threshold filtering (skip orders with >15 bids)
Subject expertise matching
Budget range filtering (avoid "Price not set" orders)
Deadline feasibility checking
Customer activity filtering (prioritize online customers)
Step 1.3: Order Scoring & Prioritization

Profitability scoring algorithm
Competition-to-reward ratio analysis
Deadline pressure assessment
Match confidence scoring
Phase 2: Intelligent Bid Strategy
Priority: HIGH - Core bidding logic improvement

Step 2.1: Context-Aware Bid Messages

Subject-specific message templates
Customer behavior-based personalization
Urgency-aware messaging
Competition-aware value propositions
Step 2.2: Dynamic Message Generation

Order requirement analysis for customization
Experience level matching to order complexity
Deadline commitment strategies
Unique selling point injection
